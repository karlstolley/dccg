<ul>
  <li>Explain the two ways script tags can be used to include JavaScript on a web page</li>
  <li>Create your own script files to include on your own web pages</li>
  <li>Explain what a JavaScript library is, and know how to include them on your web page</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">
So far, you've only used JavaScript using your in browser console. Obviously,
this approach has some limitations. When you publish a web page, you want
your JavaScript scripts deployed with it. We are going to take a break from
JavaScript as a language and look into how to incorporate scripts with your
web page.
</p>

<p>
There are two main ways to use JavaScript in your web pages. They both involve
using the <code>script</code> tag. Let's take a look at a short example.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
alert(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
This is my web page.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>
This is obviously a fairly trivial example, but it demonstrates the use
of the script tag. You can put a script tag on your page, and any code
that you put inside these tags will be interpreted as a script.
</p>

<p>
Usually we don't want to put JavaScript directly in our HTML pages, though.
It's best to separate concerns, so we should keep our JavaScript in a separate
file. To achieve the same effect as above, but without putting JavaScript
directly into our HTML, we would first create a file called <code>alert.js</code>
In this file we would put only our JavaScript code.
<br /><br />
<code>alert(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);</code>
<br /><br />
Then, in our HTML, we would do the following.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;alert.js&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
This is my web page.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>
What we did here was add a <code>src</code> attribute to the <code>script</code>
tag that points to where our JavaScript file is. If we had put the file inside
a scripts folder, we would write:
</p>

<code>
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;scripts/alert.js&quot;&gt;
</code>

<p>
Besides separation of concerns and keeping JavaScript out of our HTML, this
approach is good for reusing certain scripts across web pages. In this example,
our script was only one line long. But imagine if we had a 50 line script
that we want to run on every page of our web site. With the first approach we
looked at, we'd have to copy and paste that script on every page. By using the
<code>src</code> attribute, it's easy to include that 50 line script across
many web pages by just using one script tag.
</p>

<h1>JavaScript Libraries</h1>

<p>
When you entered the code into your JavaScript console to change the
background color of the page, you also relied on having access to a
function called <code>getRandomColor</code>. I mentioned that this was
a function that I wrote and that was include on the page.
</p>

<p>
Programmers often use code that other programmers write. If someone
has already solved a problem, a lot of times it's easier to reuse their
solution rather than to write a new one from scratch. <code>getRandomColor</code>
was just one useful function I wrote, but sometimes programmers will
package up a lot of variables and functions together and distribute them
for other programmers to use. These are often referred to as <em>frameworks</em>
or <em>libraries</em>. In the context of JavaScript, you usually use a library
by downloading a <code>.js</code> file (like the alert.js file we created above),
and then including that file using a <code>script</code> tag on any page where
you want to use it.
</p>

<p>
We're going to spend the next chapter looking at one particular very popular
JavaScript library called jQuery. The important thing to remember is just that
if you hear someone talking about a JavaScript library, they are just referring
to some code another programmer packaged up and distributed to help make your
life easier.
