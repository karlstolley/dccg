          <h2>Browser, Editor, Markdown, Command-Line</h2>

      <section>
        <p class="lead">
          Three tools are essential to the work of modern web design &amp; development, and other
          source-level writing and design endeavors.
        </p>
        <h1>Web Browser</h1>
        <p>
          You might not think much about your web browser: it's just whatever came installed with
          your computer: Safari on Mac, or Internet Explorer on Windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you should add additional browsers to your computer. Two options are Mozilla Firefox
          and Google Chrome. Both Firefox and Chrome have a variety of add-ons available to them,
          which can make design and development easier. They also help you to separate your
          development work from your casual browsing, in case you already have another browser
          you prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, though, different browsers will show you firsthand that the web looks
          different to different users. Sometimes the differences are subtle; other times, the
          differences are major. And in all cases, your designs will have to work acceptably in
          all browsers.
        </p>
        <h2>Download Time</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
          <li>Google Chrome</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Text Editor</h1>
        <p>
          As in "plain-text editor." A text editor, or simply "editor," edits plain text files. Not
          just <code>.txt</code> files, but <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>, <code>.js</code>
          and any other markup, scripting, or programming file that exists as plain text (and almost
          all of them do).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a Mac user, you might be familiar with TextEdit; similarly, Windows users may
          know the Notepad app. While both of those are plain-text editors, they don't have key
          features (most notably, syntax highlighting) that make them comfortable for the tasks
          of writing markup or scripting and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mac users should download TextWrangler; Windows users should download Notepad++.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have your new editor installed, open it up and set the following preferences
          (you might want to Google for these if you get stuck):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use UTF-8 (Unicode) character encoding, without the Byte Order Mark (BOM), as the
            default for all files
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Unix-style line endings (LF, not CR or CR+LF)
          </li>
          <li>
            Use two spaces for the tab (set up your editor so that hitting tab inserts two spaces,
            as though you'd just hit the spacebar twice)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Markdown</h1>
        <p>With your editor setup, you can, of course, just start typing text. Plain text.</p>
        <p>
          But in the absence of any formatting, you can quickly get lost in a sea of text (even the
          font in your editor is just a preference; someone opening a plain-text file of any kind
          will see it in her own preferred editor font).
        <p>
        <p>
          If you were to type long enough, you might find yourself doing certain kinds of things.
          For example, to emphasize a word, you might toss it inside of a couple of asterisks:
        </p>
<pre>
Text editors seem *really* primitive.
</pre>
        <p>
          And for bulleted lists, you might use asterisks again:
        </p>
<pre>
Primary colors:

* Red
* Blue
* Yellow
</pre>
        <p>
          For paragraphs of text, you'd probably just use an extra line of white-space, like you
          do in email or a longer Facebook status:
        </p>
<pre>
And so I'm going to write something
that's a little bit long.

In fact, it has multiple paragraphs.
Even if they're short.
</pre>
        <p>
          When you do those kinds of things, you're actually writing in Markdown syntax. Or, more
          accurately, you're writing in a pattern that was codified <i>as</i> Markdown, which is
          just a shorthand set of punctuation marks to add formatting to a document.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can read <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">the entire
          Markdown syntax specification here</a>. It's a fast read, and only once through
          it will show you all that you can do with Markdown, including headings, links, and other
          goodies.
        </p>
        <h2>Parsing Markdown</h2>
        <p>
          Markdown is everywhere. You can compose your blog posts on
          <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> in Markdown, for example. And if you open
          an Issue on a project hosted on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, you can actually
          use Markdown in your message. GitHub asks repository maintainers to keep a
          <kbd>README.md</kbd> in their projects; the <kbd>.md</kbd> stands for (you guessed it)
          Markdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tumblr and GitHub, in those cases, take your Markdown syntax, and convert it to
          <a href="/html/">HTML</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also possible to parse Markdown into HTML yourself. John Gruber, the creator of
          Markdown, maintains a Markdown text-to-html converter written in Perl. Other projects,
          like EpicEditor, are implemented for browser use. If you go to the
          <a href="http://epiceditor.com/">EpicEditor</a> home page, you can try out writing some
          Markdown, and preview how it will be rendered in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should also check your text editor; many editors can now output Markdown as HTML.
          Others,
          <a href="http://cantus.us/mac/using-markdown-in-textwrangler/">like TextWrangler</a>,
          enable you to add plugins and scripts to do the processing right inside of your editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the <a href="/git/">Git</a> portion of this resource, you'll use Markdown to make
          a Web presence on GitHub, which you'll later convert to pure <a href="/html/">HTML</a>
          and <a href="/css/">CSS</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>Command Line</h1>
        <p>
          The command line is the most complex and demanding of the four essential tools that
          you will need, so it <a href="cli.html">gets its own section</a>.
